        "  * Elliptic Curve Key Pair Generation:Generate a new key pair using the P-256 elliptic curve.\n",
        "  * Export Keys: Exporting the private and public keys in PEM format.\n",
        "  * Folder Structure: Creating a folder structure to organize keys based on user and date.\n",
        "  * Storing Keys: Saving the generated keys in the specified folder.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Signing files for Encryption\n",
        "  * Read Private Key: Read the private key from the specified file.\n",
        "  * Import Private Key: Import the private key into the ECDSA algorithm.\n",
        "  * Hash Calculation:Calculate the SHA-256 hash of the file contents.\n",
        "  * Signing: Sign the hash using the ECDSA algorithm, producing a digital signature.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Folder Signing\n",
        "  * Iterate Through Files:Iterate through each file in the specified folder.\n",
        "  * Sign Each File: For each file, obtain the digital signature.\n",
        "  * Save Signatures: Save the signatures in separate files with a specific extension.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Verification for files\n",
        "  * Read Public Key: Read the public key from the specified file.\n",
        "  * Import Public Key: Import the public key into the ECDSA algorithm.\n",
        "  * Hash Calculation: Calculate the SHA-256 hash of the received message.\n",
        "  * Verification: Verify the digital signature using the sender's public key and the calculated hash.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Folder Signature Verification\n",
        "  * Iterate Through Signature Files: Iterate through each file in the specified folder with a specific extension indicating a signature file.\n",
